# Whats's AWS?
AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services**—it's a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.

In simple terms, it’s like renting supercomputers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, you use AWS to build, run, and scale applications more efficiently.

## Think of AWS like:
* A giant digital toolbox with over 200 services—from hosting websites, to running machine learning models, to storing vast amounts of data.
* You only pay for what you use, like a utility bill.

## ☁️ Common AWS Services

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** – Run virtual servers in the cloud to host applications. You control the OS, storage, and networking.
2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** – Scalable object storage for files, backups, images, and static websites.
3. **AWS Lambda** – Run your code without managing servers. Just upload your function and AWS does the rest.
4. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** – Managed relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
5. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – Securely manage access to AWS services and resources using Users, Groups, Policies, and Roles.
6. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** – Create a logically isolated network environment within AWS for your services.
7. **Amazon CloudFront** – A global content delivery network (CDN) for fast delivery of websites, videos, and APIs.
8. **Amazon SageMaker** – Fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
9. **Amazon CloudWatch** – Monitor AWS resources and applications. Collect logs, set alarms, and analyze performance.
10. **AWS CloudFormation** – Use code templates to model and provision AWS infrastructure consistently.
