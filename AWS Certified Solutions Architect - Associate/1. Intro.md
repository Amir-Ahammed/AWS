## Whats's AWS?
AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services**‚Äîit's a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.

In simple terms, it‚Äôs like renting supercomputers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, you use AWS to build, run, and scale applications more efficiently.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Common AWS Services
- **Amazon EC2** ‚Äì Think of it like renting a virtual computer from AWS to run your apps. You choose the setup (OS, storage, etc.).
- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì A smart, secure online folder where you can keep files, backups, images, or host a static website.
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Want to run code without worrying about servers? Lambda lets you upload just your code and it runs when needed‚Äîsuper efficient!
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** ‚Äì A ready-to-use database system (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) that AWS manages for you‚Äîno manual installation or patching.
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** ‚Äì A gatekeeper for who can do what in your AWS account. You set up users, groups, and permissions to protect your stuff.
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** ‚Äì Like building your own private space inside AWS for your services. You decide the rules and who gets in.
- **Amazon CloudFront** ‚Äì Delivers your website or files super fast to people around the world by using servers near them.
- **Amazon SageMaker** ‚Äì A workspace in AWS where you can build, train, and use machine learning models‚Äîwithout being a data science expert.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** ‚Äì Keeps an eye on your AWS services. It shows performance, logs issues, and can even alert you if something breaks.
- **AWS CloudFormation** ‚Äì Use blueprints (written in code) to quickly set up AWS infrastructure the same way every time. Helpful for automation!

### üåê AWS Global Infrastructure
- **AWS Regions** ‚Äì Geographical areas that contain multiple Availability Zones. You choose where to run your services.
- **Availability Zones (AZs)** ‚Äì One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity so if one fails, others still work.
- **Data Centers** ‚Äì Real buildings full of servers where your AWS services live.
- **Edge Locations (PoPs)** ‚Äì Mini AWS hubs around the world that deliver your content faster to nearby users (used by CloudFront, Route 53).

Most AWS services are **region-scoped**, meaning resources are created and managed within a specific region.
