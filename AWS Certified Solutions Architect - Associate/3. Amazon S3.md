## Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service. It enables users to store and retrieve **any amount of data** from **anywhere on the web** at any time.

### Key Features
- **Object Storage**: Stores data as objects within buckets.
- **Unlimited Scalability**: Handles petabytes of data seamlessly.
- **High Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
- **Availability**: Designed for 99.99% uptime.
- **Security & Access Control**: Fine-grained control via IAM, bucket policies, ACLs.
- **Storage Classes**: Choose based on access needs and cost (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Glacier).
- **Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of an object.
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate transition or deletion of objects over time.

### Core Concepts

| Term            | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bucket**      | Top-level container for objects (like a folder).                           |
| **Object**      | Data stored in S3, consisting of data, metadata, and a unique key.          |
| **Key**         | Unique identifier for an object within a bucket.                           |
| **Region**      | Physical location where your bucket/data resides.                          |

## Amazon S3: Buckets
An Amazon S3 **bucket** is a container for storing **objects** (data files). All objects are stored in buckets, making them a foundational concept in S3.
- Each object is stored in a specific **bucket**.
- Buckets provide a **namespace** for object keys.
- Buckets are **created in a specific AWS region** but can be accessed globally. (S3 *appears* global but bucket creation and storage are **region-specific**.)
- Proper bucket naming is critical for DNS compatibility and service integration.

### Buckets: Naming Rules
- Bucket names must be **globally unique** across all AWS accounts and regions.
- Name requirements:
  - Must be **3–63 characters** in length.
  - Must start with a **lowercase letter or number**.
  - No uppercase letters or underscores.
  - Cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - Must **not** start with the prefix `xn--`.
  - Must **not** end with the suffix `-s3alias`.

## Amazon S3: Object
In Amazon S3, an **object** is the fundamental unit of storage. Each object contains:
- **Data**: The actual content (e.g., file, image, JSON).
- **Metadata**: Information about the object in key-value form (either system-defined or user-defined).
- **Key**: The unique identifier for the object within a bucket.
- **Version ID**: A unique identifier for the version of the object (if versioning is enabled).
- **Tags**: Up to 10 Unicode key-value pairs assigned to help with lifecycle management, security, or classification.

### Objects: Value
- Objects larger than **5GB** require a **multi-part upload** process.
- Maximum object size: **5TB (5000GB)**

## Amazon S3: Keys
- The **key** is like the full path or filename in the bucket.
- Example:  
  Key: `documents/reports/2024/q1-summary.pdf`  
  - Prefix: `documents/reports/2024/`  
  - Object Name: `q1-summary.pdf`

> 📌 S3 doesn’t have real folders—the “folder structure” is simulated by key naming using slashes (`/`).

## Amazon S3: Security Overview
Amazon S3 offers a combination of user-based and resource-based security mechanisms to control access to buckets and objects. Security in S3 is managed primarily through IAM, bucket policies, access control lists, and encryption.

### 1. User-Based Access Control
* **IAM Policies**
  - Define which **API actions** a specific IAM **user, group, or role** can perform.
  - Managed centrally in **IAM**, not in the S3 service directly.
  - Can allow or deny operations like `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, etc.

### 2. Resource-Based Access Control

* **Bucket Policy**
  - JSON-based policy attached to a bucket.
  - Can grant **cross-account access**.
  - Useful for **public access settings**, **service permissions**, and **fine-grained control** over bucket access.

* **Object Access Control List (ACL)**
  - Legacy method for granting **individual permissions** to specific users for individual objects.
  - Can be disabled for security best practice.

* **Bucket Access Control List (ACL)**
  - Legacy method for setting permissions at the bucket level.
  - Rarely used today; can also be disabled.

### 3. Authorization Logic
An IAM principal (user or role) can access an S3 object **if:**
- The **IAM policy allows** it **OR** the **resource policy (e.g., bucket policy)** allows it  
**AND**
- There is **no explicit deny** in any applicable policy

### 4. Encryption
- S3 supports encryption **at rest** and **in transit**.
- Options include:
  - **SSE-S3**: Server-side encryption with Amazon-managed keys.
  - **SSE-KMS**: Encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys.
  - **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys.
- Clients can also encrypt data **before uploading** to S3.

> ## Best Practices
> - Use **IAM roles** for applications instead of long-term access keys.
> - **Block public access** at the account and bucket level unless explicitly needed.
> - Enforce **encryption** for both data at rest and in transit.
> - **Regularly audit** bucket policies and permissions using IAM tools and S3 access logs.

## Amazon S3: Bucket Policies
A **bucket policy** is a JSON-based resource policy attached directly to an S3 bucket. It defines **who can access** the bucket or its objects, **which actions** are allowed or denied, and **what conditions** apply to those permissions.

### Key Elements of a Bucket Policy
- **Effect**: Allow or Deny.
- **Principal**: The user, role, or account the policy applies to.
- **Action**: Specific S3 API actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`).
- **Resource**: ARN of the bucket or objects (e.g., `arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*`).
- **Condition** (optional): Constraints like IP address, secure transport, or MFA.

### Public Access — Using Bucket Policy
**Use Case:** Allow anyone on the internet to read objects in a bucket (common for hosting static websites or public datasets).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
> 📌 Important: Always check and block public access settings intentionally if making a bucket public.

### User Access to S3 — Using IAM Permission
**Use Case:** Grant specific IAM users or groups access to S3 buckets using IAM policies.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
> 📌 IAM policies are user-based and should follow the principle of least privilege.

### EC2 Instance Access — Using IAM Role 
**Use Case:** Allow an EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket (e.g., for data processing or logging).

**Steps:**
- Create an **IAM Role** with an attached policy for S3 access.
- Attach the role to your EC2 instance.
- The EC2 instance uses **temporary credentials** to access S3.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
> 🧩 Ideal for avoiding long-term access keys in instance profiles.

### Cross-Account Access — Using Bucket Policy
**Use Case:** Allow another AWS account to access your S3 bucket.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CrossAccountAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
> 📌 This setup allows users from Account B to access resources in Account A's S3 bucket.

## S3: Block Public Access Settings
AWS provides settings to block public access to S3 buckets at the account or bucket level. These settings help prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Block all public access                                                 | On      | Disables all public access regardless of ACLs or policies                   |
| Block public access through new ACLs                                    | On      | Prevents public access granted via newly created ACLs                       |
| Block public access through any ACLs                                    | On      | Denies all public access granted via any ACLs                               |
| Block public access through new public bucket/access point policies     | On      | Blocks new attempts to make the bucket public using policies                |
| Block public and cross-account access via any bucket/access point policies | On   | Disallows both public and cross-account access unless explicitly permitted  |

> 📌 These settings can be configured at the **account level** or **per bucket**.  
> 📌 Recommended for most use cases where buckets are not intended to be public.
