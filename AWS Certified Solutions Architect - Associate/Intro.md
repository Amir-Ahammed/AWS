# Whats's AWS?
AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services**—it's a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.

In simple terms, it’s like renting supercomputers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, you use AWS to build, run, and scale applications more efficiently.

## Think of AWS like:
* A giant digital toolbox with over 200 services—from hosting websites, to running machine learning models, to storing vast amounts of data.
* You only pay for what you use, like a utility bill.

## Who uses AWS?
Big companies like Netflix, NASA, and even startups and students use AWS for their apps, data analysis, AI, and more.
